# About Git
## Example: Contribute to an existing repository

```
# download a repository on GitHub to our machine
# Replace `owner/repo` with the owner and name of the repository to clone
git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git

# change into the `repo` directory
cd repo

# create a new branch to store any new changes
git branch my-branch

# switch to that branch (line of development)
git checkout my-branch

# make changes, for example, edit `file1.md` and `file2.md` using the text editor

# stage the changed files
git add file1.md file2.md

# take a snapshot of the staging area (anything that's been added)
git commit -m "my snapshot"

# push changes to github
git push --set-upstream origin my-branch
```

## Example: Start a new repository and publish it to GitHub
First, you will need to create a new repository on GitHub. For more information, see "Hello World." Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore or License file. This empty repository will await your code.

```
# create a new directory, and initialize it with git-specific functions
git init my-repo

# change into the `my-repo` directory
cd my-repo

# create the first file in the project
touch README.md

# git isn't aware of the file, stage it
git add README.md

# take a snapshot of the staging area
git commit -m "add README to initial commit"

# provide the path for the repository you created on github
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git

# push changes to github
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

## Example: contribute to an existing branch on GitHub
This example assumes that you already have a project called repo on the machine and that a new branch has been pushed to GitHub since the last time changes were made locally.

```
# change into the `repo` directory
cd repo

# update all remote tracking branches, and the currently checked out branch
git pull

# change into the existing branch called `feature-a`
git checkout feature-a

# make changes, for example, edit `file1.md` using the text editor

# stage the changed file
git add file1.md

# take a snapshot of the staging area
git commit -m "edit file1"

# push changes to github
git push
```
